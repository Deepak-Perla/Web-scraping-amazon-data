0,Mayur,Poor screen quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is not a ranting review, it's friendly advice that would save you some money and time.I was using Oneplus 6 before upgrading to Oneplus 8T. Of course, wanted to experience that improved performance and high-quality display with a 120Hz refresh rate that everyone is talking about.But, the problem with Oneplus 8T is the display itself. First of all, if you are getting Oneplus 8T, you gonna have screen issues straight out of the box.Reference keywords for your Google research:- Oneplus Purple Tint- Oneplus Black Crush- Oneplus GhostingMine was Purple Tint.Remember those old phones we used to use 8 years back that had this poorly made screens which looked sharp from the front but when you tilt it to a certain extent all the colours get washed?Same happening here when I keep my phone brightness under 30%.Secondly, the screen brightness is like an old tube light. When you increase or decrease your screen brightness using the toggle in the notification panel, it will take some time to respond to the change.For example: if I increase my brightness from 30% to 70%, it will take a good half-second to respond to that change. Increasing brightness on this device is not instant on this device is all I am saying.Sadly, the phone at this price point can't even keep up with the competition when it comes to the screen quality.Lastly, I would highly recommend reading some Google reviews before buying this product."

2,Anugrah Garnal,First experience shifting to OnePlus,2.0 out of 5 stars,"  1) Got this device delivered yesterday and it started heating up during the setup stage only. I ignored it for a while. After charging, thought of transferring my data from my old device to this and with just with just contacs, messages and approx 20 songs the device started heating up again.2) Next, having a warp charger doesn't make sense if the battery is drains at a pretty good speed.3) I have my Airtel sim in the 2nd slot but I cannot use 4g data in that and it is always on 2g network only, God knows why? And OnePlus is marking it as a 5G flagship.About to return the product.Really disappointed."
3,Abhilash,"Great performance, Fluid device but lacks wah feeling",3.0 out of 5 stars,"  Review  (12GB):This phone has very good performance. I ordered Lunar silver but received Aquamarine green. I dont' want to spend more time on this, so kept it.Pros:=> Great performance/speed for SD 865 processor=> Battery life is fine=> Priced ok considering highend features the phone provides, but misses a wahh feeling considering it a high end phone.=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helpsCons:=> Experienced high heating when using the InShare app for sharing media.=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this.  After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. (Update: I received an oxygen OS 11.x.x update on Nov 2, and it has the fixes for heating issues, heating is reduced).As others are complaining there is=> No display tint issues=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% chargingRear Camera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. But 16 MP front cam does a bad job when took pics from a distance in timer mode. Getting unclear pics. Selfies coming good. But camera lacks features considering 46k price.No telephoto, no zoom. Nowadays its NOT a flagship killer, its a business for OnePlus.Edited after 6 months of usage. Reduced the rating."
4,Yoga,Great Mobile from OnePlus!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"  This is my first OnePlus mobile so I can't compare with other OnePlus mobiles.Pros:120hz display for smoother display and touch experienceFast charging : 0 - 100 % within an hour in optimzed charging mode (else it'll charge in 40 mins, I didn't try it). Battery backup is also very good.No curved display : Personally I like flat displays as curved one is more prone to get cracks and damage easilyCase and Screen protector : you will get case in the box and Screen protector already applied to mobile which are of very decent quality.Oxygen 11: comes with Android 11 based Oxygen 11 OS and features are very cool.Performance : I have been using it from last 4 days but didn't notice any lags. But I am not a gamer so Can't say how it performs while gaming.Misc: Watched a water durability test video which claims it's water resistant but there is no official IP rating on it. Front and back side of the mobile are protected by Corning gorilla glass 5.Rest all specs like 5g, 865 Snapdragon, RAM, Storage, Camera setup,Full aluminium body etc are similar to OnePlus 8.During sale got the mobile with 1 year screen protection plan from ACKO without any extra cost.Cons:Front camera : I felt selfie camera quality could have improved. Looks like software issue, hope OnePlus will fix it in their future updates.Wide angle camera : Needs some improvement.Monochrome camera : I don't think so it's useful, anyone can apply filter and convert the picture to B/W. For the sake of quad camera it's just present.I don't see any other cons, I hope the software issues for cameras that I mentioned in the cons section will get fixed in future s/w updates. Really it's a great mobile.Edit- after used for a weekBack camera is struggling a lot in artificial light conditions."
5,Aniesh Varghese,Think and wait before you buy,3.0 out of 5 stars,  Product is good except camera. Oxygen Os is not upto the mark this time. Seems they haven't done proper testing on android 11.After spending 45k u will get a normal camera which was there in 7t and buggy OS.Every now and then you will get errors. Many useful functions which was there on older oneplus device is removed from this device. Stereo speaker is not upto the mark. Storage related issue is there due to which we cannot install certain apps even though the phone has 200 gb storage available.Hope they come out with updates to solve the problems.I would rate 3 star for this device atleast for now.

Size seems huge compared to the previous one .3. Camera is a big improvement over the old one.4 . 30 minutes to a full charge.Pl buy if you have a old version of one plus .Will upgrade my review after a month to list any defeciencies if noticed .
7,3SA,Everything is best except for camera...Go for the 12GB variant...,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  VERDICTDisplay - 9/10Performance - 10/10Battery - 10/10Charging - 10/10Sound & Haptics - 9/10Camera - 8/10Software - 10/10Overall - 9.5/10GO FOR THE 12GB variant. For just an extra 3k, you get 4 GB additional RAM & 128 GB additional storage. They have priced the top variant extremely well and offers excellent value over the base variant.This is my review after 8 days of use (I bought mine on the very 1st day :) of sale - 16th):I am a long time user of OnePlus devices, so I knew what to expect. Oxygen OS is the best version of Android even today. However, it is unfortunate that OnePlus has started bundling a few unwanted stuff in their software.Those are as follows:1. Login with OnePlus account/  Red Cable Club (RCC) - This is present in the Indian devices and cannot be removed. I don't know why they want to force it upon us.2. OnePlus Cloud - A cloud service which may be useful for some, but forcing it on everyone is unacceptable. A big 'Sign in to Cloud' box shows on your face in the Gallery app and cannot be removed. Very annoying.3. Zen Mode - deeply integrated with the system. This is in addition to the default Digital Wellbeing app.4. Preinstalled apps like Netflix (cannot be uninstalled), OnePlus Buds, Amazon, and a handful of others. These can, however be uninstalled.5. CAMERAS - This is the only disappointment from hardware point of view. Instead of giving the macro and monochrome lenses, they should have given a telephoto lens. That would have been much more useful. I am fine without IP68 & wireless charging.6. In-display Fingerprint scanner is a bit glitchy. Often fails to register (and therefore read) fingerprint properly. I think this is a software issue and can be fixed with an update.Pros1. No Facebook services pre-installed. After backlash in the community for installing that in the Nord devices, they acted wisely by removing it and not including it in the 8T.2. Display is great with 120Hz AMOLED. I don't have the black crush issue. But I notice the green tint problem when the brightness is very low (around 10% with auto-brightness enabled) and the display seems to struggle a bit. It is random and NOT present all the time. You will notice this only in pitch dark environments. Unless this is a device-specific quality related issue, I am not too bothered because it is hardly noticeable.3. Charging - The most unique part of this phone. Super fast charging. I usually put it on charge when the battery is around 20% and it fully charges under 40 minutes.4. Battery life is great. I have consistently got over 6 hours of screen-on-time everyday. I charge around 20%, so if I push it, I know I can get about 8 hours SOT. But it is NOT advisable to let the battery charge drop below 15%.5. OOS is fluid and super fast. RAM management is great too. With 12GB RAM, I don't have to worry about it. There are a few minor software bugs, and I hope the company would fix them soon. Nothing that would make for a poor user experience though.6. I don't have any heating issues. The phone gets warm to the touch when doing video calls, and that is normal.7. Gaming is great and no lags or any issues. I must say I haven't played too much except for testing purposes.8. Speakers are great with nice haptic feedback. Dolby Atmos is included, but I didn't find any improvement with it. Hopefully they will allow that to be tweaked more in future updates.9. Call quality and network reception/ connectivity are all great.10. Face unlock is superfast.If you are into photography and need best cameras on your phone, this is NOT for you. Even the Samsung Galaxy S20FE has better cameras at a similar price point. Other than that, this is the best phone under 50k if you are okay with no wireless charging/ IP68.Please note that I am NOT saying that the camera is bad. Just that it is not the best, and I wish they had included a telephoto lens. You can take very good pictures with the 8T and Nightscape is amazing. The pictures produced by the 8T are not photography perfect (when judged on specific parameters), but still great for viewing and especially for sharing on social media."
8,Pavan,Great but not excellent,4.0 out of 5 stars,"  Classic Oneplus product as you'd expect from a flagship killer aka non flagship device.1. Performance and software : Awesome is the least word to describe how fast this phone is. Adding to perform, there is oxygen os11 which has been refined and new features.2. Display: I had issues with my previous oneplus 7t, but thankfully there is none with this device. It is a gorgeous looking panel.3 Built quality: Again excellent built quality. But they should have provided more variety of colours like black and blue.4. Battery and charging: Battery life is very good, it lasts longer than I expected it to be. Charging speed is nuts, take that how ever you want to, it's just super fast.5 Camera: It's good for the price, but when you look at the competition, pixel and S20FE, they have better cameras. Not saying it's bad just it falls behind the competition in this price segment. It's the only weak part of this phone because the rest all things of this phone are soo good that this camera system makes itself visible as a potential weakness in it. Still though it's a good camera.Honorable mentions : Dear ONEPLUS, I've been a fan from the first phone you have launched and I've personally used it which is the one plus one and I've used many other oneplus phones after that and there after many of my family members and friends began to buy considering the value you provide for the amount we are paying. But there are certain things which has to be mandatory if you consider any phone a flagship i.e wireless charging and a proper IP rating.Personally this is a major draw back of the phone considering its competition, the S20FE has both and many people may go for samsung just because of those 2 reasons which adds to the durability of the phone. Hope you hear me out and include those 2 major check points in the coming models."
